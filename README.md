Hello,
this is just a simple JS to Idle Gametime in Steam.
It also supports Steam's 2FA you just need your sharedsecret.

Things you need:
node-steam              Get this with "npm install steam"
node-steam-topt         Get this with "npm install steam-totp"

I recommand using a VPS with screen so it's open 24hrs

Here are some advantages of this JS:
- Low CPU load
- Idle multible Games
